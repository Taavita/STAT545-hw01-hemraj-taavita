# STAT545-hw01-hemraj-taavita 
This is the first homework that is complete in the STAT 545 class.
Welcome STAT 545 peers, instructor, and TA's. 
I tried to make commits remotely through RStudio but ran into a lot of trouble in terms of committing the changes and pushing them through. I will followup in office hours to get this concept clear. 
THE PROCESS: 
To edit my repository README file, I entered my changes through the github database. To do so, I clicked on my read me file and selected the 'edit' button in the top right hand corner. To save these changes that I made, I clicked the command "commit to changes" located at the bottom of this page on the left hand side. While I attempted to make changes on this file remotely through RStudio, I found it very difficult to have a clear understanding of what changes I was making, what files I was working from, and where things were happpening. The changes I tried to commit to this file remotley did not work and I will be seeking extra help to address this knowledge gap.
